                <h3>Marcell Symonds</h3>
                <p class="pageText">
                    For close to 50 years Marcell has established himself as a household name when it comes to black
                    male vocalists in Nova Scotia. Marcell presents a smooth crooning style, yet powerful voice.
                    Marcells dynamic and enchanting personality can quickly captivate his audience.

                    Recognizing his passion for singing, his parents, the late Rev. and Mrs. Calvin Symonds enrolled him
                    into the Maritime Conservatory of Music when he was nine years old. Marcell excelled and over the
                    next 7 years received his diploma for voice honors, while he continued to sing in church
                    collectively as well as a soloist.

                    Marcell was chosen as one of only four Nova Scotians selected to perform at the 2nd World Black, and
                    African Festival of Arts and Culture, which was held in Lagos, Nigeria, Africa. Marcell experienced
                    a trip of a lifetime and everlasting memories performing in the “Motherland.”

                    Marcell continues to receive unlimited invitations to entertain as an announcer, emcee, jingle
                    singer, lead singer for bands as well as a soloist. His versatility in all genres and his contagious
                    energy are a delight!

                    To his credit, Marcell boasts a gospel CD, “Just a Closer Walk” (Sharp 5 Productions), and has an
                    acoustical project underway.

                    Marcell looks forward with an uncontrollable enthusiasm as he continues to warm the hearts of all
                    who hear him sing.
